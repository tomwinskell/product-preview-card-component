## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [https://sass-lang.com/](SASS)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts](Google Web Fonts Helper - self-hosting of Google Fonts)
- [https://www.cursor.com/](Cursor)

### What I learned

- ##SCSS and SASS##. There is still a lot to learn. Some features are helpful in writing re-usable / organized CSS.
- ##Self-hosting Google Fonts##. Will continue to use this for future projects.
- ##Cursor##. It is helpful to code with LLM because I can ask questions and complete repetive tasks quicker. I do have to be mindful using this tool because AI will auto-complete code incorrectly at times. For me, coding still requires a human.

## Acknowledgments

I appreciate the feedback Steven Stroud @stroudy on FrontEnd mentor gave. Following his comments has allowed me to progress my knowledge on this project.
